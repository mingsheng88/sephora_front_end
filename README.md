# sephora_front_end

> Sephora front end Vue.js project

## General Comments

As of the time of writing, I am absolutely at ground-zero w.r.t. SPA frameworks like Vue.js / React.js. Therefore, based on 1 week of experience, I am pleased with the implementation. The corresponding Backend Project can be found [here](https://github.com/mingsheng88/sephora_technical_test).

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
